## Design Pillars:
List up to 3 words/phrases that convey the feeling or emotion you want the player to experience. (Example: Turn-based. Strategy. Political intrigue.)
## Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary:
List what the game is from a gameplay and/or story perspective. (Example: Traverse a giant open-world attempting to turn all of the blue glowy places into orange glowy places.)
## Features: 
List the features and elements that you want to include in your game. Try to decide if they are must-haves ("Core") or optional.
