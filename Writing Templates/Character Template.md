Adapted from [[Writing Mastery - Story Groundwork Worksheet]]

## Character Groundwork Level 1
### 1) Brainstorm the following basic information for your main character:
-   Name:
-   Main or side character:
-   Age (or rough age):
-   Pronoun:
-   Current Location (where are they at the start of the story?):
-   Nationality:

### 2) Brainstorm 5 details about this person 
(This can be anything from physical appearance to personality to backstory to likes/dislikes, whatever you want!) 
- 

## Character Groundwork Level 2
### 3) Take 2 of the details from your Level 1 list and flesh them out 
(e.g. if you brainstormed something about the character’s appearance, where did they get that trait? From mom? Dad? How do they feel about that trait? Do they like it? Do they wish they could change it? Do people compliment it? Do they try to hide it?)  
- 

### 4) OPTIONAL: Brainstorm any of the details that inspire you from the [[Character Profile Questions]]
- 

## Character Groundwork Level 3
### 5) Brainstorm a PROBLEM your character is facing at the start of the story
(This can be internal or external)
- 

### 6) Brainstorm what your character WANTS at the start of the story  
(This should be something tangible that the character is pursuing)
- 

## Character Groundwork Level 4
#### 7) Brainstorm how your character’s PROBLEM reveals a deeper-rooted FLAW 
(If the problem is internal, start by brainstorming what caused it. If the problem is external, start by asking how your character reacts to it)
- 

#### 8) Brainstorm what will allow your character to overcome this flaw 
(also referred to as the character’s NEED or LIFE LESSON) (What does your character need to learn by the end of the story in order to better themselves and improve their flawed existence?)
- 

## Character Groundwork Level 5
#### 9) Brainstorm as much of the [[Character Profile Questions]] as you can
- 
  
#### 10) OPTIONAL: Write a scene from your character’s backstory 
(This can be any length and cover any moment in your character’s life, although try to zero in on a moment that helps you better define the elements you’ve already brainstormed in the previous levels (like a problem, flaw, or goal.)
